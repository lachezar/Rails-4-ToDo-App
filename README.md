Rails-4-ToDo-App
================

Just trying out Rails 4 + jQuery 2 + Giphy API

So, I decided to use Ubuntu 12.10 and test Ruby Mine IDE (JetBrains) for development. I had to install Oracle's JDK from [http://www.devsniper.com/ubuntu-12-04-install-sun-jdk-6-7/](http://www.devsniper.com/ubuntu-12-04-install-sun-jdk-6-7/).

Then I installed Ruby 2.0.0 using RVM following the instructions on [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
